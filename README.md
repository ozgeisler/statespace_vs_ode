## State-Space vs ODE Response Comparison (4th Order System)

This project compares the time response of a 4th-order dynamic system
modeled in two equivalent forms:

- State-space representation
- Explicit ODE formulation using integrator chains

The system is defined by a companion-form state matrix and simulated
using MATLAB and Simulink under identical initial conditions and inputs.

The results confirm the equivalence between state-space and ODE models,
highlighting numerical solver effects and modeling clarity.
